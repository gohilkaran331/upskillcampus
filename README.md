My project name is Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production . Instead of cultivating different types in different seasons, farmers produce the same crop every season. They also apply more fertilizer without knowing its exact composition or dosage. In order to describe the best crop to produce and the fertilizer to seed based on soil and weather circumstances, we developed a recommendation model based on machine learning and data science

To run the project, download zip file of repository and run the Prediction_of_Agriculture_crop_app.py file from the repository.
